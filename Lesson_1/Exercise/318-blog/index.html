            <b>Department 318</b> ,<i> Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control</i> (CMC) Bioanalysis, is located in CMC Drug Product
            Development, R&D, Novo Nordisk A/S. We use and optimize bioanalysis to support a range of developing medicines
            in diabetes, haemophilia and obesity. The department works with cell-based bioassays, clotting and enzymatic
            assays as well as ELISA assays and different molecular biology methods. There are three teams in the
            department,...

            This is a database for department 318, that is still on progress. The development of the database is started with
            the team 2. The database is ready for COA analysis and is currently working on QRA analycis, it will continue with QuantitativeResponseAssay as both of
            the data comes from BioGraph software. Then the development will continue on to the data from Magellan software
            and hopfully will reach to the qPCR as well... cheers :)
